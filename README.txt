WHAT GETS STANDARDIZED?
----------------------
APK-MobileStructure performs the following actions:
1. Flattens nested project structures
2. Creates standard directory hierarchy for source code, assets, and tests
3. Generates essential documentation files (README, LICENSE, CHANGELOG, CONTRIBUTING)
4. Sets up configuration files (.gitignore, analysis options)
5. Creates CI/CD GitHub workflow files
6. Produces a comprehensive REPOSITORY_STRUCTURE.md document

EXAMPLE USE CASES
----------------
Scenario 1: Inherited Messy Project
    You've taken over a Flutter app with files scattered everywhere. Running 
    APK-MobileStructure immediately brings order to chaos, letting you focus on 
    development rather than organization.

Scenario 2: Starting a New Project
    You're beginning a new Android app and want to ensure you follow best practices 
    from day one. APK-MobileStructure sets up everything you need to get started right.

Scenario 3: Preparing for Open Source
    You want to publish your app on GitHub but need proper documentation and structure. 
    APK-MobileStructure creates all necessary files and organizes your code to professional 
    standards.
